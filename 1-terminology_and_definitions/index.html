      <li class="question">
        Why is it important to write clean code?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            Clean code is important because it makes it easier to understand, maintain, and modify the codebase. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            Good comments provide meaningful context, explanation, and clarification of the code, and are written in a clear and concise manner. <br> 
            On the other hand, bad comments are redundant, outdated, or irrelevant, and do not add any value to the code. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is an array?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            An array is a data structure in programming that holds an ordered collection of elements, which can be of any data type such as numbers, strings, objects, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What are arrays useful for?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            Arrays are useful for storing collections of data of the same or different data types in a single variable. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        How do you access an array element?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            An array element can be accessed by its index number. The index number of an array starts from 0 for the first element, and goes up to n-1, where n is the total number of elements in the array.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        How do you change an array element?
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">
          You can change an array element by simply assigning a new value to a specific index of the array.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="question">
        What are some useful array properties?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            length: returns the number of elements in the array. <br>
            indexOf(): returns the first index at which a given element can be found, or -1 if it is not present in the array. <br>
            join(): concatenates all elements of an array into a string and returns it. <br>
            slice(): extracts a portion of an array and returns it as a new array. <br>
            sort(): sorts the elements of an array in ascending or descending order. <br>
            reverse(): reverses the order of elements in an array. <br>
            map(): creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array. <br>
            reduce(): applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What are some useful array methods?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            push() - adds an element to the end of an array. <br>
            pop() - removes an element from the end of an array. <br>
            unshift() - adds an element to the beginning of an array. <br>
            shift() - removes an element from the beginning of an array. <br>
            splice() - allows adding or removing elements from any position in an array.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What are loops useful for?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            Loops are useful for repeating a set of operations multiple times, either a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and can be used to iterate over arrays, objects, or any other data structure in order to perform a certain operation on each element.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is the break statement?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The break statement is a control flow statement used to immediately exit or break out of a loop, bypassing the normal loop condition and execution of the remaining loop statements. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is the continue statement?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The continue statement is used to skip over the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In other words, it skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is the DOM?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like hierarchy of nodes, with each node representing an element, attribute, or text content. The DOM allows developers to programmatically manipulate and access the content, structure, and style of a document, enabling the creation of dynamic, interactive web pages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        How do you target the nodes you want to work with?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is a hierarchical representation of a web page as a tree-like structure, where each element on the page is represented as a node. To target the nodes you want to work with in the DOM, you can use a variety of methods including: <br>
            Using selectors such as CSS selectors, to select specific elements based on their class, id, tag name, etc. <br>
            Using JavaScript properties such as getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName() and querySelector() to select elements based on their id, class name, tag name or a combination of these. <br>
            Traversing the DOM tree and accessing the parent, child, and sibling nodes of elements, to find the elements you want to work with.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        How do you create an element in the DOM?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            To create an element in the DOM, you can use JavaScript to create a new element object and then append it to an existing element using methods like document.createElement and appendChild.
